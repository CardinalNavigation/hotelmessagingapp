I went with react because I wanted to create a quick prototype and be able to see the data I am working with.
It will also be really easy to get the user manipulating the data once I am able to get the JSON text displayed to the screen.

ToDos:

1. Have some sort of structure or object for working with template messages that have placeholders/variables (i.e. firstName, lastName, roomNumber, etc.) embedded in them
2. Load in message template information from a JSON file that you will have had created. Structure the file however you see fit
3. Load in guest and company information from the JSON files that we have provided
4. Support a greeting variable that will change based on the time of day (e.g. "Good morning" / "Good afternoon" / "Good evening")
5. Allow the user to specify which guest and which company should be used to populate template messages.
6. Allow the user to either select one of the message templates that was loaded in from the JSON file or to enter in a new message
   template
7. Generate a final message output that is a result of populating the specified variables of the message template with the correct values
   from the other data
